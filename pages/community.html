        <p>Life Groups are small communities of people from within our church who are meeting regularly, intentionally, and journeying with one another in faith and life.</p>
        <p>Life Groups exist to Build-Up and Equip the believer for life and godliness. To facilitate growth in the knowledge and practice of our faith with the goal of becoming more like Jesus as we live out the great commandments and the great commission.</p>
        <p>To join a group, please use the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1q-RK9dQI9N9FVUEcVWy4ZMNXW6OtGtSxU-BtJD9gbnk/edit">sign up form here</a> or contact <a href="mailto:office@bearsdenbaptistchurch.com">office@bearsdenbaptistchurch.com.</a></p>

      <div class="cy-body">
        <p>The Well-Come Café is a community space to promote wellbeing in our local community. We offer a loving and safe environment where everyone is accepted. We offer gentle activities, crafts and refreshments, all free of charge, but equally, a place to simply sit and feel accepted.</p>
        <p>Named after John 4:1-42, it is now open from 2-4pm every Wednesday, in Room 2 of Maxholme (the older section of the building).</p>
        <p>The café is a loving, safe and non-judgemental place where everyone is accepted. There will be activities, crafts and refreshments provided but also simply the opportunity to rest and be human together.</p>
        <p>A short time of prayer using Psalm 103 or the Lord’s Prayer, to which all are invited without obligation, will be offered at the end of each session and there will be the opportunity to signpost people to further helpful resources or agencies in the local community, if needed.</p>
        <p>If you or anyone you know among friends, neighbours, family or colleagues are struggling with loneliness, weariness, grief, anxiety or depression, please know you are welcome here! All are welcome in the kingdom of God!</p>
        <p>For more information, contact us.</p>

We are a friendly group run by church volunteers.</p>
        <p>In our time together there are various activities: crafts, free play, special baby area, songs and story time, books, puzzles and Lego activities. Snack time for kids and coffee and delicious treats for the adults. We sometimes have a puppet show and a variety of special activities throughout the year, especially at Christmas and Easter.</p>
        <p>The group is based on Christian principles and teaching, and we offer a listening ear and prayer if wanted.</p>
        <p>Every year we support a chosen charity, usually caring for the poor and children.</p>

      <div class="cy-body">
        <p>Lunch Break is a lunchtime activity held every second Tuesday 12.30 to 2.30 p.m. from September to June.</p>
        <p>Who can come? Those who attend are mainly senior citizens, but anyone is welcome.</p>
        <p>What do we do? We eat lunch together – delicious sandwiches, quiche and sausage rolls (sometimes warm cheese scones or soup over the colder winter months!) Following lunch, we have a time of singing together when we choose our favourite Christian songs, followed by a talk from a guest speaker. We try to vary the topics, and they can range from telling us about charities they represent, to a personal testimony of what God is doing in their daily lives.</p>
